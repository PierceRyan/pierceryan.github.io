I am a postdoctoral researcher in Applied Mathematics at University College Cork, supervised by Dr. Kieran Mulchrone. My research interests include nonlinear dynamics, data modelling, and the modelling of Internet systems. I made this website to host my CV, published research, and any unpublished projects I decide to share!
