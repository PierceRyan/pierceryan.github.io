I am a lecturer and PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at University College Cork, supervised by [Andreas Amann](http://publish.ucc.ie/researchprofiles/D019/aamann) and [Sorcha Healy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sorchahealy/). My research interests include nonlinear dynamics, data modelling, and the modelling of Internet systems.

This website is currently under construction, so check back when I've finished adding my existing portfolio! I'll have links to my CV, teaching activities, published research, and any other little projects I decide to share!
