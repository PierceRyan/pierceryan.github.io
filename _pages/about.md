I am a lecturer in Applied Mathematics at University College Cork. I recently successfully defended my thesis for a PhD in Applied Mathematics under the supervision of [Andreas Amann](http://publish.ucc.ie/researchprofiles/D019/aamann) and [Sorcha Healy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sorchahealy/). My research interests include nonlinear dynamics, data modelling, and the modelling of Internet systems. I made this website to host my CV, published research, and any unpublished projects I decide to share!
