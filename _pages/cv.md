Education
======
* PhD in Applied Mathematics, University College Cork, 2018 - 2023
* Postgraduate Certificate in Teaching & Learning in Higher Education, University College Cork, 2023 - present
* BSc Mathematical Sciences, First Class Honours, University College Cork, 2014 - 2018

Work experience
======
* 2023 - Present: Postdoctoral Researcher
  * University College Cork
  * I currently work on an industry-partnered research project to develop sophisticated inventory management systems for emergency vehicles. This involves applying machine learning techniques to both on-vehicle high-frequency live data and global event-based server data.

* 2022 - 2023: Lecturer in Applied Mathematics
  * University College Cork
  * I had sole responsibility for the teaching, examination, and administration of four Applied Mathematics modules taken by undergraduate and postgraduate students. These included mechanics, tensor algebra, partial differential equations, and network science. See my [Teaching](https://pierceryan.github.io/teaching/) page for further details.

* 2018 - 2022: Malware Researcher
  * McAfee LLC
  * As part of the McAfee Artificial Intelligence Research team, I conducted research developing new solutions to
current problems in cybersecurity. My work consisted of:
      * Studying emerging malware threats in a Big Data environment to enhance the protective capabilities of McAfee’s software as part of the Artificial Intelligence Research team.
      * Performing data analytics on very large, high dimensional datasets using cloud computing-based data science and machine learning tools, such as AWS and Databricks.
      * Writing Invention Disclosure Forms to enable the Legal team to apply for patents based on my research.
  
* 2020 - 2022: Assistant Lecturer
  * University College Cork
  * I had sole responsibility for the teaching, examination and administration of AM3051: Vector & Tensor Methods, an Applied Mathematics module taken by third & fourth year Mathematical Sciences students. See my [Teaching](https://pierceryan.github.io/teaching/) page for further details.
