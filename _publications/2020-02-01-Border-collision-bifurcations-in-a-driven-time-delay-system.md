excerpt: 'We show that a simple piecewise-linear system with time delay and periodic forcing gives rise to a rich bifurcation structure of torus bifurcations and Arnold tongues, as well as multistability across a significant portion of the parameter space. The simplicity of our model enables us to study the dynamical features analytically. Specifically, these features are explained in terms of border collision bifurcations of an associated Poincar√© map. Given that time delay and periodic forcing are common ingredients in mathematical models, this analysis provides widely applicable insight.'
