From 2020 to 2022, I had sole responsibility for the teaching, examination, and administration of this module, taken by third year Mathematical Sciences students.
This module introduces the tensor algebra required for advanced partial differential equations modules, and covers topics such as solving the Laplace equation in spherical and cylindrical coordinates.
