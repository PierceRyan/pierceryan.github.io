I had sole responsibility for the teaching, examination, and administration of this module, taken by over 100 first year Mathematical Sciences students.
The goal of this module is to provide an understanding of the fundamentals of vector algebra through the application of Newtonian mechanics.  I supervised 4 undergraduate tutors who give tutorials for this module.
