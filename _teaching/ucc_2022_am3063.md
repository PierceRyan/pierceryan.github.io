I had sole responsibility for the teaching, examination, and administration of this module, taken by third year and fourth year undergraduate students and postgraduate students.
The core goal of this module is to teach the fundamentals of vector algebra through the application of Newtonian mechanics. This module covers methods of solving first and second-order PDEs, including classical examples such as the wave equation.
